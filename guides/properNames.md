## §1 Elementary Grammar and Lexicon

Lexicon and grammar for Sumerian names follow Attinger (2021/2023), Jagersma (2010), Sallaberger (2023). Akkadian names: von Soden: AHw., GAG, Streck/Wende: LAOS 7 (including vowel lengths), and concerning the dialectal differences, see [§11](#11-additional-fundamental-studies-to-onomastics). Amorite names: Streck (2000), Golinets (2018). Hurrian names: Richter (2016); Other first millennium West Semitic names: following Radner/Baker (eds.): PNA.

## §2 Characters in Addition to Standard Alphabet

Akkadian in T and N: **ḫ**, **ṣ**, **š**, **ṭ**, **ś** (OAkk); in N: **ā**, **ē**, **ī**, **ū**, **â**, **ê**, **î**, **û**, **y, ʾ** (Aleph)[^1]

Sumerian in T and N: **ĝ**, **ḫ**, **š**; in N: **y**[^2]

Amorite: **ḫ**, **ṣ**, **š**, **ṭ**; in N: **ā**, **ē**, **ī**, **ū**, **â**, **ê**, **î**, **û**, **w**, **y,** **ʾ** (Aleph), **ʿ** (ʿAyin), **ḏ**, **ġ**, **ḥ**, **ś**, **ṯ**, **ẓ**[^3]

Hurrian in T and N: **ḫ**, **š**; in N: **w**, **y**[^4]

## §3 Capitalization

Transliterated signs are not capitalized to indicate a proper name.

In normalized forms, all proper names are capitalized.

a) *šu-eš*₁₈-*tár* = Šu-Eštar "he of Eštar," but *šu-ì-lí-šu* = Šu-ilīšu "he of his god."

b) ur-<sup>d</sup>en-lil₂-la₂ = Ur-Enlila "Dog of Enlil."[^5]

## §4 Hyphenation in N

In Semitic (e.g., Akkadian or Amorite) and Hurrian names, each word with its affixes is separated by a hyphen from other words with their affixes.

In Sumerian names, hyphens separate (1) internal proper names with their affixes and (2) finite verbal forms.[^6]

a) Sîn-lā-šanān "Sîn is without equal" and Sîn-tillassu "Sîn is his protection."

b) (1) Ur-Enlilagen; Urlugal, (2) Lu-izu "the person knows," Lukala "cherished person."

Month names before the Ur III period and year names overall are not hyphenated.[^7]

c) mu <sup>d</sup>amar-<sup>d</sup>zuen lugal "year: Amar-Suen (became) king (AS 1)."

d) iti izim munu₄-gu₇ <sup>d</sup>nin-ĝir₂-su-ka-ka "in the month of Ninĝirsu's malt-eating festival."

## §5 Reading and Normalizing Names

Names are not reconstructed but transliterated and normalized according to the cuneiform signs, grammar, vocabulary (based on AHw/dialectal dictionaries for Akkadian), and etymology.

a) <sup>d</sup>SUEN-*i-din-nam* = Sîn-iddinam "Sîn gave to me," **not** Sîn-idinnam. 

b) *e-gar-šu-e-mid* = Igāršu-ēmid "I leaned against his wall," **not** Egāršu-ēmid.

c) ur-<sup>d</sup>en-lil₂ = Ur-Enlil "one of Enlil," **not** Ur-Enlila, Ur-Enlilak, or Enlilâk.[^8]

d) urdu₂-ĝu₁₀ = Urduĝu "my slave," **not** Urdudĝu.

The abstraction and connection of the same name written differently is undertaken in the step of identifying entities, not by standardizing names in N (differently in PNA, p. XXII).

Cuneiform signs are only read if the choice is unambiguous.

e) Akkadian *bu-la*-NI = BulāNI (uncertain etymology).

f) LU₂-AN is read lu₂-AN = LuAN.[^9]

## §6 Specific Rules for Month and Year Names

(see also [§4](#4-hyphenation-in-n))

Non-proper month and year names (not hyphenated) are translated with an additional abbreviation in N. Proper month names are **not** translated. Month numbers are only added when the sequence is certain. In Akkadian texts, logographically written month names are converted into Akkadian in N from OB onwards. In such cases, <sup>iti</sup> becomes a classifier.

a) Early OB Nippur written in Sumerian: iti še-KIN-ku₅ = month: ŠeKINku (xii).

b) OB written in Akkadian: iti še-KIN-ku₅ = month: *Addaru* (xii).

Example of year name is found under [§4c](#4-hyphenation-in-n).

Q: Abbreviations for rulers, source for month equivalizations, sequences, need reference studies

## §7 Specific Rules for Akkadian

### §7.1 Logograms

Logograms are converted into Akkadian when normalized, **not** in T.

a) *ì-lí*-BAD₃-*ri* = Ilī-dūrī "my god is my wall."

Readings of logograms in Akkadian, independent of period follow MesZL; logograms from the Ur III period and earlier follow the Sumerian readings of Attinger (2021/2023).

b) DINGIR*-na-ṣir* (OB); DINGIR*-ba-ni* (Ur III), **not** diĝir-*ba-ni*.

c) <sup>d</sup>SUEN*-i-din-nam* (OB); <sup>d</sup>SUEN*-dú-rí* (Ur III), **not** <sup>d</sup>zuen-*dú-rí*.

The normalization of logograms follows the grammar of the respective dialect; key references are listed in [§11](#11-additional-fundamental-studies-to-onomastics); additional examples for dialectal differences are found under [§7.3](#73-reproducing-dialectal-differences).

d) LU₂-*ia* (MA) = Aˀīlīya, **not** Awīlīya.

e) LU₂-<sup>d</sup>*šá-maš* (NA) = Amēl-Šamaš, **not** Awīl-Šamaš.

f) ARAD-<sup>d</sup>UTU = Warad-Šamaš (OB), Urad-Šamaš (MA), Arad-Šamaš (MB, NB), Urad-Šamaš (NA).[^10]

g) <sup>d</sup>NIN-E₂.GAL-*lè-id-ni-ni* (MA) = Bēlat-ekalle-idninni, not Bēlet-ekallim-idninni.

h) DINGIR-ŠEŠ-DU₃ (NB/LB) = Ilu-aḫu-ibni, not Il-aḫ-ibni or Ilu-aḫa-ibni.

i) <sup>d</sup>EN-NUMUN-DU₃ (NB/LB) = Bēl-zēru-ibni, not Bēl-zēr-ibni or Bēl-zēra-ibni.

Logograms in names without written suffixes are normalized as nouns+1. P. Sg. possessive suffixe (following Hölscher 1996: 12).

Such logograms include: ILLAT = tillatī, AN.DUL₃ = ṣulūlī.

I₃-LI₂ is used as an Akkadogram, often parallel to DINGIR.

j) I₃-LI₂-*a-wi-lim-ra-bi* (OB) = Il-awīlim-rabi "The deity of the person is grand."

k) *a-wi-il*-DINGIR (OB) = Awīl-ilim // *a-wi-il*-I₃-LI₂ (OB) = Awīl-ilim "Man of the deity."

### §7.2 PaRiS vs. PāriS

Verbs-of-**doing** are interpreted as **participles** and verbs-of-being as statives.

a) DINGIR-*šu-ba-ni* = Ilšu-bāni "his deity is the creat**or**," but *be-lí-a-rí-ik* = Bēlī-arik "my lord is long."

### §7.3 Reproducing Dialectal Differences

Declination: If [§5](#5-reading-and-normalizing-names) does not apply, mostly with logograms or signs like -LIM and most examples are found under [§7.1](#71-logograms):

Cases (including mimation):[^11]

- Ur III, OB: Triptotic with mimation (*-um*/*-im*/*-am*).
- MB: Triptotic without mimation (*-u*/*-i*/*-a*); MA: *-u*/*-e*/*-a*.
- First millennium: Diptotic without mimation (*-u*/*-i*).[^12]

a) *a-wi-lu-ma* = Awīlumma (OB).

but b) *a-wi-la-tum* = Awīlatum (OB) following [§5](#5-reading-and-normalizing-names).

c) *a-wi-il-tu*₄-*ba-ni-tu*₄ = Awīltu-banītu (MB).

For phonological and morphological features see Kouwenberg 2017: 11 (OA), Wende 2022: 262–263 (OB), Leonhardt 2024: 663–667 (NA), Leonhardt 2024: 668–678 (NB), and for all dialects Vita (2021, HdOr I.152/II).

### §7.4 Hypocorisms and the Nisbe

Hypocorisms and nisbes are normalized as -āya/-āyu, īya, but -ūa, **not** ūya.

a) BA-*šá-a* (NB/LB) = Iqīšāya, **not** Iqīšâ "the he gifted."

b) DU₃-*ia* (NB/LB) = Bānīya, **not** Bānia "the creator."

c) SIPA-*ú-a* (MB) = Rēʾûa, **not** Rēʾûwa or Rēʾûya "the herder."

## §8 Specific Rules for Sumerian

Realization of the Genitive: see [§5](#5-reading-and-normalizing-names) and especially examples (6–8) in the [Appendix](#appendix-additional-examples).

### §8.1 Double Consonants

Double consonants are not used when a phonogram takes up the last consonant of a logogram.

a) an-na "of/in heaven" = ana, **not** anna; kal-la "cherished" = kala, **not** kalla.

Double consonants are used to distinguish different words, such as a-ba "who" = aba and ab-ba "elder" = abba.

Double-consonant words include: adda (ad-da), "father," Alla *a deity*, Lamma *a protective deity*, Nanna *the moon god*, saĝĝa "temple lord," and ummia (um-mi-a) "master."

### §8.2 Realization of Vowels

Vowels of different words in contact are normalized as given in T.[^13]

For example, ulu₃-da-a = Ulud**aa**, aia₂-siki-a-ne₂ = Ayasik**ia**ne, and ur-<sup>d</sup>sul-pa-e₃ = Ur-Sulp**ae**.

Name internal cases are rendered in N as expressed in the script.

For example, <sup>d</sup>nanna-a-ĝar-ra "Nanna supplied," = Nannaa-ĝara, **not** Nanna-ĝara or Nannae-ĝara.

In hypocoristics: "...Ca-a" = "...Caya," "...Ce-a" ="...Ceya," and "...Ci-a" = "...Ciya."

For example, a-ab-ba-a = Aabbaya and da-da-a = Dadaya.

## §9 Normalizing (Logographical) Divine and Settlement Names

Logographical readings of deity and geographic names follow MesZL, not PNA. Whether signs are understood as syllabic or logographical also follows MesZL.

a) Akkadian <sup>d</sup>*en-líl*, **not** <sup>d</sup>EN.LIL₂ (=Ellil or Illil), <sup>d</sup>*é-a*, **not** <sup>d</sup>É.A.

b) Akkadian <sup>d</sup>ME.ME = Gula; <sup>d</sup>*gu-la*, **not** <sup>d</sup>GU.LA = Gula.

c) Akkadian <sup>d</sup>INANNA, not <sup>d</sup>INANA = Ištar, **not** Issār.[^14]

d) Akkadian <sup>d</sup>NIN.LIL₂/<sup>d</sup>*nin-líl* = Mulliltu, Mullissu, or Mulliššu.

Playful writings are normalized with the intended god.

e) AN.ŠAR₂.GAL = Anu.

## §10 No Conventional Normalizations of Names

Irienimgena, instead of Urukagina = iri-enim-ge-na

Sulge, instead of Šulgi = <sup>d</sup>sul-ge, see also [Appendix (10)](#appendix-additional-examples)

ʿAmmu-rāpi**ʾ**, instead of Ḫammurapi = ḫa-mu-ra-pi₂

Aššur-bāni-apli, instead of Assurbanipal = e.g., AN.ŠAR₂-DU₃-A[^15]

Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur, instead of Nebuchadnezzar = e.g., <sup>d</sup>AG-NIG₂.DU-URU₃

## Notes

[^1]: y replaces j (AHw, GAG), following English spelling. For OAkk ś, following Sommerfeld (1999, Imgula 3.1: 26–28), e.g., dan-al-śu = Dān-ālśu "his city is strong."

[^2]: y in words, like aia/aia₂ = Aya "father." Replaces j, following English spelling.

[^3]: Characters like **ˀ** (Aleph), **ˁ**(Ain), **ḏ**, **ġ**, **ḥ**, **ś**, **ṯ**, **ẓ** are not used in the transliterations as the Old Babylonian texts use the Akkadian sign inventory. y replaces j (Streck 2000, AOAT 271.1), following English spelling.

[^4]: y replaces j (Richter 2016), following English spelling.

[^5]: In Ur-Enlila, both the theophoric element as well as the personal name itself are proper names, thus both are capitalized.

[^6]: Separating all words with affixes in Sumerian names, as in Semitic ones, would lead to endlessly fragmented names, see [Appendix (11) and (12)](#appendix-additional-examples).

[^7]: Example d) stems from the Presargonic period. For early month names, see Sallaberger (2021, St.Chab. 9).

[^8]: ur-<sup>d</sup>en-lil₂ = Ur-Enlil, but ur-<sup>d</sup>en-lil₂-la₂ = Ur-Enlila; **not** Ur-Enlilak, Ur-Enlilâk, etc..

[^9]: LU₂-AN could either be interpreted as lu₂-diĝir(-ra) "person of a deity" or lu₂-an(-na) "person of heaven." Both names, lu₂-diĝir-ra and lu₂-an-na, exist.

[^10]: Syllabic writings of *urdu* are rare. Two examples are *ur-di-li* = Urdi-ili/ī "servant of (the) god(s)" and *ur-du-a-da* = Urdu-Adda, which could be West Semitic, not Assyrian.

[^11]: Wende (2022: 92–95) argues that the mimation was still used in the OB period, as only between 2.8% and 6.7% of mimations are missing, depending on the archive.

[^12]: Loss of triptotic declension according to Streck 2014: *Die Kasusflexion im Status rectus des Neu- und Spätbabylonischen*, AOAT 369. D Diptotic system following the standard of Waerzeggers/Groß (2024), Jursa (2005), and Baker (2002).

[^13]: Glides, glottal stops, lengths, or other phonetical additions are not inserted. The transcription is neutral, and diphthongs are not suggested.

[^14]: Cf. the readings in PNA 1: xxv.

[^15]: Transliteration follows the readings of MesZL in line with [§7.1](#71-logograms). In first millennium tertiae infirmae forms, the coda vowel is preserved, thus -bāni-, not -bān-.
